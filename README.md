#Summary
------

I used old code from CS1400 for this project. I used classes TestScores and TestScores Demo. What testScores does is it creates an array of type float,
prints out the input and calculates that average, and also checks if userinput is valid. testScoresDemo is the main class of testScores that creates 
new objects. The first input is valid so the average is calculated as well aa a printed list of every number in the array. The second input is invalid 
because it tries to put in a negative number in the array to which the code now throws an IllegalArgument Exception. The code also checks for all 
other exceptions. After that I opened a new terminal at the folder which contains the code. I created a new repository and then used git status. After
that I added the files to the new repository by using git add . and then checked the status again. I went ahead and added one commit to testScores and 
one to testScoresDemo. I went ahead and used git commit -m 'first commmit' to add those changes. Github was then used to create a new repository and 
add in the file from git to github to track the changes.
